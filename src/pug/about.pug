      h2 Who are we?
      p Input Labs Oy. (OsakeYhti√∂) is a small company established in Finland, Europe.
      p Founded in 2022 by 2 friends, both engineers and gamers: Marcos (born in Spain) and Michael (born in Germany). Later several friends joined as testers, idea givers and contributors. And now we are waiting for you.
      p You can talk with us on #[+ax(org.discord) Discord] anytime.

      h2 Our principles and goals
      p We embrace #[em open source], backward compatibility, right to repair, and privacy. We are disgusted by FOMO, predatory sales, and people imposing their preferences.
      p We may #[em not be your typical startup], as our goal is not to grow artificially, but to create a stable environment for research and development.
      p We #[em welcome and support] everyone in our community, we do not leave anyone behind.

      h2 Do you sell controllers?
      p Short answer: No.
      p Long answer: We are selling selected #[em components] and #[em DIY kits], and try to make as easy as possible for people to build their own DIY controllers, adapted to their needs.
      p: i "We give you the recipe, but you cook the pizza".
      p The Alpakka #[+a('alpakka/components') components] page outlines which components are required to build a controller and from where to source them.

      h2 What does the logo mean?
      p The logo is a sinusoidal wave representing an analog signal, being captured by code brackets (digital), in the shape of an hexagon, because hexagons are the #[a.egg(target='_blank' href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thOifuHs6eY') bestagons].
      p: del I'm not high, I promise.
      p When you think blue, green, or red, you associate these with some specific videogame brands, right? We don't settle with a single color, because #[em.wrap our favorite color is your favorite color].

      h2 Why these funny animal names?
      p We named our 2 first devices Alpakka and Kapybara, these are actually spelt correctly in finnish language. That's our little tribute to Finland, a country that took us as their own fellows.
      p We also find funny when gaming companies call their products with 90's style rad animal names, such as the #[i "Cobra"], #[i "Black Puma"], or #[i "Death Hornet"] #[i (not actual names)].
      p Instead we go for the most huggable, weird, and cute animals. Please give us ideas for the next ones!
