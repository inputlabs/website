      h2 Who are we?
      p #[em Input Labs Oy.] (OsakeYhtiö) is a small company established in Finland, Europe.
      p Founded in 2022 by 2 friends, both engineers and gamers: Marcos (born in Spain) and Michael (born in Germany). Later several friends joined as testers, idea givers and contributors. And now we are waiting for you.

      h2 Our principles and goals
      p We embrace #[em open source], backward compatibility, right to repair, and privacy. We are disgusted by FOMO, predatory sales, and people imposing their preferences.
      p We may #[em not be your typical startup], as our goal is not to grow artificially, but to create a stable environment for research and development.
      p We #[em welcome and support] everyone in our community, we do not leave anyone behind.

      h2 What does the logo mean?
      p The logo is a sinusoidal wave representing an analog signal, being captured by code brackets (digital), in the shape of an hexagon, because hexagons are the #[a.egg(target='_blank' href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thOifuHs6eY') bestagons].
      p: del I'm not high, I promise.
      p When you think blue, green, or red, you associate these with some specific videogame brands, right? We don't settle with a single color, because #[em.wrap our favorite color is your favorite color].

      h2 Why these funny animal names?
      p We named our 2 first devices Alpakka and Kapybara, these are actually spelt correctly in finnish language. That's our little tribute to Finland, a country that took us as their own fellows.
      p We also find funny when gaming companies call their products with 90's style rad animal names, such as the #[i "Cobra"], #[i "Black Puma"], or #[i "Death Hornet"] #[i (not actual names)].
      p Instead we go for the most huggable, weird, and cute animals. Please give us ideas for the next ones!
